    "The music recommendation problem - why is this a challenge:\n",
    "1. Scale of catalog - over 30 million songs available, how to determine which ones a user will like and listen to next?\n",
    "2. Repeated consumption - unlike movies, television or books, users will listen to the same or similar tracks over and over, which can generate a lot of noise in the data\n",
    "3. Music taste tends to be quite idiosyncratic and each user can have _vastly_ different preferences. As an example, some kinds of music that I like:\n",
    "    * Instrumental guitar solos (e.g. Stevie Ray Vaughn)\n",
    "    * Classic rock (e.g. AC/DC, Led Zeppelin)\n",
    "    * 90's rap and hip hop (e.g. Tupac, Nas)\n",

    "\n",
    "Spotify uses three primary types of modelling techniques to create the \"Discover Weekly\" playlist and other music recommendation applications/algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative filtering\n",
    "1. Analysis and comparison of a user's behaviour and preferences versus other users and their preferences\n",
    "2. Focus is on using user data to make predictions (e.g. number of times a particular song is played, songs saved on playlists, etc.)\n",
    "3. Aggregate and remove temporal aspects of user data and then create (very large, sometimes sparse) matrices that represent user behaviour across genres, demographics, etc.\n",
    "4. Theoretical size of MxN, where M is number of users (140 million users) and N is number of songs available (30 million songs)\n",
    "5. Basically a lot of matrix multiplication, but optimization techniques are needed due to the large volume of data and high number of features (matrix factorization, probabilistic latent semantic analysis)\n",
    "6. Spotify uses Luigi (Python) to build complex pipeline of jobs in order to enable collaborative filtering model workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural Language Processing\n",
    "1. Analysis of track metadata, music blogs, forums, social media, etc. to determine what adjectvies and descriptions are available for specific songs or artists\n",
    "2. Categorise into buckets and then assign weights to each song/artist to determine probability that a particular description will be used to describe that item\n",
    "3. These weighted categorical representations are then converted to a vector representation of a song/artist, which can then be used for comparison to determine similarity between songs or artists\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw audio analysis\n",
    "1. Used primarily to include new songs that might not have enough social media/mainstream data or user playtime data\n",
    "2. Analysis of raw features of the audio track (e.g. key, tempo, valence, duration, time signatures, verse/chorus frequency and breakdown, mode, etc.)\n",
    "3. Spotify uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyse time-frequency representations of audio frames (basically excerpts of songs) and compute statistics of individual songs based on more musically objective factors"
